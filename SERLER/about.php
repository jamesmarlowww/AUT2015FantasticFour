<p>(SERLER = SERL Evidence Repository. SERL = Software Engineering Research Lab at AUT)</p>
<p>Brief Description of Application</p>
<p>SERL wishes to host a repository for capturing evidence relating to software development methods and will populate the repository with evidence relating to a selection of methods.
Access to the repository will be available via web service interface.</p>

<p>The larger aim for creating such a repository is to build a body of evidence that will support  researchers and practitioners in decision-making during software projects.
The repository system, i.e. data storage plus access mechanisms, will be named SERLER.</p>

<p>The application to be developed is a structure repository of data on empirical studies of software engineering practices. </p>
